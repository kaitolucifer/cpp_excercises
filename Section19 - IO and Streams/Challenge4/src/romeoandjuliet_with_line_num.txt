1         Romeo and Juliet

2         ACT I
3         PROLOGUE
4         Two households, both alike in dignity,
5         In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
6         From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
7         Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
8         From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
9         A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
10        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
11        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
12        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
13        And the continuance of their parents' rage,
14        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
15        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
16        The which if you with patient ears attend,
17        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
18        SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
19        Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
20        SAMPSON
21        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
22        GREGORY
23        No, for then we should be colliers.
24        SAMPSON
25        I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
26        GREGORY
27        Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
28        SAMPSON
29        I strike quickly, being moved.
30        GREGORY
31        But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
32        SAMPSON
33        A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
34        GREGORY
35        To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
36        therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
37        SAMPSON
38        A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
39        take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
40        GREGORY
41        That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
42        to the wall.
43        SAMPSON
44        True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
45        are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
46        Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
47        to the wall.
48        GREGORY
49        The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
50        SAMPSON
51        'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
52        have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
53        maids, and cut off their heads.
54        GREGORY
55        The heads of the maids?
56        SAMPSON
57        Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
58        take it in what sense thou wilt.
59        GREGORY
60        They must take it in sense that feel it.
61        SAMPSON
62        Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
63        'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
64        GREGORY
65        'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
66        hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
67        two of the house of the Montagues.
68        SAMPSON
69        My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
70        GREGORY
71        How! turn thy back and run?
72        SAMPSON
73        Fear me not.
74        GREGORY
75        No, marry; I fear thee!
76        SAMPSON
77        Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
78        GREGORY
79        I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
80        they list.
81        SAMPSON
82        Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
83        which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
84        Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

85        ABRAHAM
86        Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
87        SAMPSON
88        I do bite my thumb, sir.
89        ABRAHAM
90        Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
91        SAMPSON
92        [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
93        ay?
94        GREGORY
95        No.
96        SAMPSON
97        No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
98        bite my thumb, sir.
99        GREGORY
100       Do you quarrel, sir?
101       ABRAHAM
102       Quarrel sir! no, sir.
103       SAMPSON
104       If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
105       ABRAHAM
106       No better.
107       SAMPSON
108       Well, sir.
109       GREGORY
110       Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
111       SAMPSON
112       Yes, better, sir.
113       ABRAHAM
114       You lie.
115       SAMPSON
116       Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
117       They fight

118       Enter BENVOLIO

119       BENVOLIO
120       Part, fools!
121       Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
122       Beats down their swords

123       Enter TYBALT

124       TYBALT
125       What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
126       Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
127       BENVOLIO
128       I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
129       Or manage it to part these men with me.
130       TYBALT
131       What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
132       As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
133       Have at thee, coward!
134       They fight

135       Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

136       First Citizen
137       Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
138       Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
139       Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

140       CAPULET
141       What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
142       LADY CAPULET
143       A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
144       CAPULET
145       My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
146       And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
147       Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

148       MONTAGUE
149       Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
150       LADY MONTAGUE
151       Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
152       Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

153       PRINCE
154       Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
155       Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
156       Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
157       That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
158       With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
159       On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
160       Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
161       And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
162       Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
163       By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
164       Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
165       And made Verona's ancient citizens
166       Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
167       To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
168       Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
169       If ever you disturb our streets again,
170       Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
171       For this time, all the rest depart away:
172       You Capulet; shall go along with me:
173       And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
174       To know our further pleasure in this case,
175       To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
176       Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
177       Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

178       MONTAGUE
179       Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
180       Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
181       BENVOLIO
182       Here were the servants of your adversary,
183       And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
184       I drew to part them: in the instant came
185       The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
186       Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
187       He swung about his head and cut the winds,
188       Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
189       While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
190       Came more and more and fought on part and part,
191       Till the prince came, who parted either part.
192       LADY MONTAGUE
193       O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
194       Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
195       BENVOLIO
196       Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
197       Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
198       A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
199       Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
200       That westward rooteth from the city's side,
201       So early walking did I see your son:
202       Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
203       And stole into the covert of the wood:
204       I, measuring his affections by my own,
205       That most are busied when they're most alone,
206       Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
207       And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
208       MONTAGUE
209       Many a morning hath he there been seen,
210       With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
211       Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
212       But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
213       Should in the furthest east begin to draw
214       The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
215       Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
216       And private in his chamber pens himself,
217       Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
218       And makes himself an artificial night:
219       Black and portentous must this humour prove,
220       Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
221       BENVOLIO
222       My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
223       MONTAGUE
224       I neither know it nor can learn of him.
225       BENVOLIO
226       Have you importuned him by any means?
227       MONTAGUE
228       Both by myself and many other friends:
229       But he, his own affections' counsellor,
230       Is to himself--I will not say how true--
231       But to himself so secret and so close,
232       So far from sounding and discovery,
233       As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
234       Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
235       Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
236       Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
237       We would as willingly give cure as know.
238       Enter ROMEO

239       BENVOLIO
240       See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
241       I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
242       MONTAGUE
243       I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
244       To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
245       Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

246       BENVOLIO
247       Good-morrow, cousin.
248       ROMEO
249       Is the day so young?
250       BENVOLIO
251       But new struck nine.
252       ROMEO
253       Ay me! sad hours seem long.
254       Was that my father that went hence so fast?
255       BENVOLIO
256       It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
257       ROMEO
258       Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
259       BENVOLIO
260       In love?
261       ROMEO
262       Out--
263       BENVOLIO
264       Of love?
265       ROMEO
266       Out of her favour, where I am in love.
267       BENVOLIO
268       Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
269       Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
270       ROMEO
271       Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
272       Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
273       Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
274       Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
275       Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
276       Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
277       O any thing, of nothing first create!
278       O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
279       Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
280       Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
281       sick health!
282       Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
283       This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
284       Dost thou not laugh?
285       BENVOLIO
286       No, coz, I rather weep.
287       ROMEO
288       Good heart, at what?
289       BENVOLIO
290       At thy good heart's oppression.
291       ROMEO
292       Why, such is love's transgression.
293       Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
294       Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
295       With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
296       Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
297       Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
298       Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
299       Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
300       What is it else? a madness most discreet,
301       A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
302       Farewell, my coz.
303       BENVOLIO
304       Soft! I will go along;
305       An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
306       ROMEO
307       Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
308       This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
309       BENVOLIO
310       Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
311       ROMEO
312       What, shall I groan and tell thee?
313       BENVOLIO
314       Groan! why, no.
315       But sadly tell me who.
316       ROMEO
317       Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
318       Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
319       In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
320       BENVOLIO
321       I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
322       ROMEO
323       A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
324       BENVOLIO
325       A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
326       ROMEO
327       Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
328       With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
329       And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
330       From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
331       She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
332       Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
333       Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
334       O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
335       That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
336       BENVOLIO
337       Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
338       ROMEO
339       She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
340       For beauty starved with her severity
341       Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
342       She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
343       To merit bliss by making me despair:
344       She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
345       Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
346       BENVOLIO
347       Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
348       ROMEO
349       O, teach me how I should forget to think.
350       BENVOLIO
351       By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
352       Examine other beauties.
353       ROMEO
354       'Tis the way
355       To call hers exquisite, in question more:
356       These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
357       Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
358       He that is strucken blind cannot forget
359       The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
360       Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
361       What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
362       Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
363       Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
364       BENVOLIO
365       I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
366       Exeunt

367       SCENE II. A street.
368       Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
369       CAPULET
370       But Montague is bound as well as I,
371       In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
372       For men so old as we to keep the peace.
373       PARIS
374       Of honourable reckoning are you both;
375       And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
376       But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
377       CAPULET
378       But saying o'er what I have said before:
379       My child is yet a stranger in the world;
380       She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
381       Let two more summers wither in their pride,
382       Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
383       PARIS
384       Younger than she are happy mothers made.
385       CAPULET
386       And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
387       The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
388       She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
389       But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
390       My will to her consent is but a part;
391       An she agree, within her scope of choice
392       Lies my consent and fair according voice.
393       This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
394       Whereto I have invited many a guest,
395       Such as I love; and you, among the store,
396       One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
397       At my poor house look to behold this night
398       Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
399       Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
400       When well-apparell'd April on the heel
401       Of limping winter treads, even such delight
402       Among fresh female buds shall you this night
403       Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
404       And like her most whose merit most shall be:
405       Which on more view, of many mine being one
406       May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
407       Come, go with me.
408       To Servant, giving a paper

409       Go, sirrah, trudge about
410       Through fair Verona; find those persons out
411       Whose names are written there, and to them say,
412       My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
413       Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

414       Servant
415       Find them out whose names are written here! It is
416       written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
417       yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
418       his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
419       sent to find those persons whose names are here
420       writ, and can never find what names the writing
421       person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
422       Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

423       BENVOLIO
424       Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
425       One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
426       Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
427       One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
428       Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
429       And the rank poison of the old will die.
430       ROMEO
431       Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
432       BENVOLIO
433       For what, I pray thee?
434       ROMEO
435       For your broken shin.
436       BENVOLIO
437       Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
438       ROMEO
439       Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
440       Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
441       Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
442       Servant
443       God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
444       ROMEO
445       Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
446       Servant
447       Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
448       pray, can you read any thing you see?
449       ROMEO
450       Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
451       Servant
452       Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
453       ROMEO
454       Stay, fellow; I can read.
455       Reads

456       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
457       County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
458       widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
459       nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
460       uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
461       Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
462       Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
463       assembly: whither should they come?

465       Up.
466       ROMEO
467       Whither?
468       Servant
469       To supper; to our house.
470       ROMEO
471       Whose house?
472       Servant
473       My master's.
474       ROMEO
475       Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
476       Servant
477       Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
478       great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
479       of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
480       Rest you merry!

483       At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
484       Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
485       With all the admired beauties of Verona:
486       Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
487       Compare her face with some that I shall show,
488       And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
489       ROMEO
490       When the devout religion of mine eye
491       Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
492       And these, who often drown'd could never die,
493       Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
494       One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
495       Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
496       BENVOLIO
497       Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
498       Herself poised with herself in either eye:
499       But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
500       Your lady's love against some other maid
501       That I will show you shining at this feast,
502       And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
503       ROMEO
504       I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
505       But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

509       LADY CAPULET
510       Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
511       Nurse
512       Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
513       I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
514       God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
515       Enter JULIET

516       JULIET
517       How now! who calls?
518       Nurse
519       Your mother.
520       JULIET
521       Madam, I am here.
522       What is your will?
523       LADY CAPULET
524       This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
525       We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
526       I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
527       Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
528       Nurse
529       Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
530       LADY CAPULET
531       She's not fourteen.
532       Nurse
533       I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
534       And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
535       She is not fourteen. How long is it now
536       To Lammas-tide?
537       LADY CAPULET
538       A fortnight and odd days.
539       Nurse
540       Even or odd, of all days in the year,
541       Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
542       Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
543       Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
544       She was too good for me: but, as I said,
545       On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
546       That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
547       'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
548       And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
549       Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
550       For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
551       Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
552       My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
553       Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
554       When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
555       Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
556       To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
557       Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
558       To bid me trudge:
559       And since that time it is eleven years;
560       For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
561       She could have run and waddled all about;
562       For even the day before, she broke her brow:
563       And then my husband--God be with his soul!
564       A' was a merry man--took up the child:
565       'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
566       Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
567       Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
568       The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
569       To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
570       I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
571       I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
572       And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
573       LADY CAPULET
574       Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
575       Nurse
576       Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
577       To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
578       And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
579       A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
580       A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
581       'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
582       Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
583       Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
584       JULIET
585       And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
586       Nurse
587       Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
588       Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
589       An I might live to see thee married once,
590       I have my wish.
591       LADY CAPULET
592       Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
593       I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
594       How stands your disposition to be married?
595       JULIET
596       It is an honour that I dream not of.
597       Nurse
598       An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
599       I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
600       LADY CAPULET
601       Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
602       Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
603       Are made already mothers: by my count,
604       I was your mother much upon these years
605       That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
606       The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
607       Nurse
608       A man, young lady! lady, such a man
609       As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
610       LADY CAPULET
611       Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
612       Nurse
613       Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
614       LADY CAPULET
615       What say you? can you love the gentleman?
616       This night you shall behold him at our feast;
617       Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
618       And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
619       Examine every married lineament,
620       And see how one another lends content
621       And what obscured in this fair volume lies
622       Find written in the margent of his eyes.
623       This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
624       To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
625       The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
626       For fair without the fair within to hide:
627       That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
628       That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
629       So shall you share all that he doth possess,
630       By having him, making yourself no less.
631       Nurse
632       No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
633       LADY CAPULET
634       Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
635       JULIET
636       I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
637       But no more deep will I endart mine eye
638       Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
639       Enter a Servant

640       Servant
641       Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
642       called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
643       the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
644       hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
645       LADY CAPULET
646       We follow thee.
647       Exit Servant

648       Juliet, the county stays.
649       Nurse
650       Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
651       Exeunt

652       SCENE IV. A street.
653       Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
654       ROMEO
655       What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
656       Or shall we on without a apology?
657       BENVOLIO
658       The date is out of such prolixity:
659       We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
660       Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
661       Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
662       Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
663       After the prompter, for our entrance:
664       But let them measure us by what they will;
665       We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
666       ROMEO
667       Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
668       Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
669       MERCUTIO
670       Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
671       ROMEO
672       Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
673       With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
674       So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
675       MERCUTIO
676       You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
677       And soar with them above a common bound.
678       ROMEO
679       I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
680       To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
681       I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
682       Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
683       MERCUTIO
684       And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
685       Too great oppression for a tender thing.
686       ROMEO
687       Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
688       Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
689       MERCUTIO
690       If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
691       Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
692       Give me a case to put my visage in:
693       A visor for a visor! what care I
694       What curious eye doth quote deformities?
695       Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
696       BENVOLIO
697       Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
698       But every man betake him to his legs.
699       ROMEO
700       A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
701       Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
702       For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
703       I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
704       The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
705       MERCUTIO
706       Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
707       If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
708       Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
709       Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
710       ROMEO
711       Nay, that's not so.
712       MERCUTIO
713       I mean, sir, in delay
714       We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
715       Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
716       Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
717       ROMEO
718       And we mean well in going to this mask;
719       But 'tis no wit to go.
720       MERCUTIO
721       Why, may one ask?
722       ROMEO
723       I dream'd a dream to-night.
724       MERCUTIO
725       And so did I.
726       ROMEO
727       Well, what was yours?
728       MERCUTIO
729       That dreamers often lie.
730       ROMEO
731       In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
732       MERCUTIO
733       O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
734       She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
735       In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
736       On the fore-finger of an alderman,
737       Drawn with a team of little atomies
738       Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
739       Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
740       The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
741       The traces of the smallest spider's web,
742       The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
743       Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
744       Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
745       Not so big as a round little worm
746       Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
747       Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
748       Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
749       Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
750       And in this state she gallops night by night
751       Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
752       O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
753       O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
754       O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
755       Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
756       Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
757       Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
758       And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
759       And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
760       Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
761       Then dreams, he of another benefice:
762       Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
763       And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
764       Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
765       Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
766       Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
767       And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
768       And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
769       That plats the manes of horses in the night,
770       And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
771       Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
772       This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
773       That presses them and learns them first to bear,
774       Making them women of good carriage:
775       This is she--
776       ROMEO
777       Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
778       Thou talk'st of nothing.
779       MERCUTIO
780       True, I talk of dreams,
781       Which are the children of an idle brain,
782       Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
783       Which is as thin of substance as the air
784       And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
785       Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
786       And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
787       Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
788       BENVOLIO
789       This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
790       Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
791       ROMEO
792       I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
793       Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
794       Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
795       With this night's revels and expire the term
796       Of a despised life closed in my breast
797       By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
798       But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
799       Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

806       Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
807       shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
808       Second Servant
809       When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
810       hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
811       First Servant
812       Away with the joint-stools, remove the
813       court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
814       me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
815       the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
816       Antony, and Potpan!
817       Second Servant
818       Ay, boy, ready.
819       First Servant
820       You are looked for and called for, asked for and
821       sought for, in the great chamber.
822       Second Servant
823       We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
824       brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
825       Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

826       CAPULET
827       Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
828       Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
829       Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
830       Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
831       She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
832       Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
833       That I have worn a visor and could tell
834       A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
835       Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
836       You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
837       A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
838       Music plays, and they dance

839       More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
840       And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
841       Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
842       Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
843       For you and I are past our dancing days:
844       How long is't now since last yourself and I
845       Were in a mask?
846       Second Capulet
847       By'r lady, thirty years.
848       CAPULET
849       What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
850       'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
851       Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
852       Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
853       Second Capulet
854       'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
855       His son is thirty.
856       CAPULET
857       Will you tell me that?
858       His son was but a ward two years ago.
859       ROMEO
860       [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
861       enrich the hand
862       Of yonder knight?
863       Servant
864       I know not, sir.
865       ROMEO
866       O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
867       It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
868       Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
869       Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
870       So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
871       As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
872       The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
873       And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
874       Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
875       For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
876       TYBALT
877       This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
878       Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
879       Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
880       To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
881       Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
882       To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
883       CAPULET
884       Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
885       TYBALT
886       Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
887       A villain that is hither come in spite,
888       To scorn at our solemnity this night.
889       CAPULET
890       Young Romeo is it?
891       TYBALT
892       'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
893       CAPULET
894       Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
895       He bears him like a portly gentleman;
896       And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
897       To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
898       I would not for the wealth of all the town
899       Here in my house do him disparagement:
900       Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
901       It is my will, the which if thou respect,
902       Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
903       And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
904       TYBALT
905       It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
906       I'll not endure him.
907       CAPULET
908       He shall be endured:
909       What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
910       Am I the master here, or you? go to.
911       You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
912       You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
913       You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
914       TYBALT
915       Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
916       CAPULET
917       Go to, go to;
918       You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
919       This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
920       You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
921       Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
922       Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
923       I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
924       TYBALT
925       Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
926       Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
927       I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
928       Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
929       Exit

930       ROMEO
931       [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
932       This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
933       My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
934       To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
935       JULIET
936       Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
937       Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
938       For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
939       And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
940       ROMEO
941       Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
942       JULIET
943       Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
944       ROMEO
945       O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
946       They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
947       JULIET
948       Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
949       ROMEO
950       Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
951       Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
952       JULIET
953       Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
954       ROMEO
955       Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
956       Give me my sin again.
957       JULIET
958       You kiss by the book.
959       Nurse
960       Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
961       ROMEO
962       What is her mother?
963       Nurse
964       Marry, bachelor,
965       Her mother is the lady of the house,
966       And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
967       I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
968       I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
969       Shall have the chinks.
970       ROMEO
971       Is she a Capulet?
972       O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
973       BENVOLIO
974       Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
975       ROMEO
976       Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
977       CAPULET
978       Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
979       We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
980       Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
981       I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
982       More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
983       Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
984       I'll to my rest.
985       Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

986       JULIET
987       Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
988       Nurse
989       The son and heir of old Tiberio.
990       JULIET
991       What's he that now is going out of door?
992       Nurse
993       Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
994       JULIET
995       What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
996       Nurse
997       I know not.
998       JULIET
999       Go ask his name: if he be married.
1000      My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1001      Nurse
1002      His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1003      The only son of your great enemy.
1004      JULIET
1005      My only love sprung from my only hate!
1006      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1007      Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1008      That I must love a loathed enemy.
1009      Nurse
1010      What's this? what's this?
1011      JULIET
1012      A rhyme I learn'd even now
1013      Of one I danced withal.
1014      One calls within 'Juliet.'

1015      Nurse
1016      Anon, anon!
1017      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
1018      Exeunt

1019      ACT II
1020      PROLOGUE
1021      Enter Chorus
1022      Chorus
1023      Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1024      And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1025      That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1026      With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1027      Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1028      Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1029      But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1030      And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1031      Being held a foe, he may not have access
1032      To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1033      And she as much in love, her means much less
1034      To meet her new-beloved any where:
1035      But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1036      Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1037      Exit

1038      SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1039      Enter ROMEO
1040      ROMEO
1041      Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1042      Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1043      He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

1044      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

1045      BENVOLIO
1046      Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1047      MERCUTIO
1048      He is wise;
1049      And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1050      BENVOLIO
1051      He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1052      Call, good Mercutio.
1053      MERCUTIO
1054      Nay, I'll conjure too.
1055      Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1056      Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1057      Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1058      Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1059      Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1060      One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1061      Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1062      When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1063      He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1064      The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1065      I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1066      By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1067      By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1068      And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1069      That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1070      BENVOLIO
1071      And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1072      MERCUTIO
1073      This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1074      To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1075      Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1076      Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1077      That were some spite: my invocation
1078      Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1079      I conjure only but to raise up him.
1080      BENVOLIO
1081      Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1082      To be consorted with the humorous night:
1083      Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1084      MERCUTIO
1085      If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1086      Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1087      And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1088      As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1089      Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1090      An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1091      Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1092      This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1093      Come, shall we go?
1094      BENVOLIO
1095      Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1096      To seek him here that means not to be found.
1097      Exeunt

1098      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1099      Enter ROMEO
1100      ROMEO
1101      He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1102      JULIET appears above at a window

1103      But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1104      It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1105      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1106      Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1107      That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1108      Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1109      Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1110      And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1111      It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1112      O, that she knew she were!
1113      She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1114      Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1115      I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1116      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1117      Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1118      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1119      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1120      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1121      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1122      Would through the airy region stream so bright
1123      That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1124      See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1125      O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1126      That I might touch that cheek!
1127      JULIET
1128      Ay me!
1129      ROMEO
1130      She speaks:
1131      O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1132      As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1133      As is a winged messenger of heaven
1134      Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1135      Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1136      When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1137      And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1138      JULIET
1139      O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1140      Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1141      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1142      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1143      ROMEO
1144      [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1145      JULIET
1146      'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1147      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1148      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1149      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1150      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1151      What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1152      By any other name would smell as sweet;
1153      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1154      Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1155      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1156      And for that name which is no part of thee
1157      Take all myself.
1158      ROMEO
1159      I take thee at thy word:
1160      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1161      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1162      JULIET
1163      What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1164      So stumblest on my counsel?
1165      ROMEO
1166      By a name
1167      I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1168      My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1169      Because it is an enemy to thee;
1170      Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1171      JULIET
1172      My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1173      Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1174      Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1175      ROMEO
1176      Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1177      JULIET
1178      How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1179      The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1180      And the place death, considering who thou art,
1181      If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1182      ROMEO
1183      With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1184      For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1185      And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1186      Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1187      JULIET
1188      If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1189      ROMEO
1190      Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1191      Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1192      And I am proof against their enmity.
1193      JULIET
1194      I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1195      ROMEO
1196      I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1197      And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1198      My life were better ended by their hate,
1199      Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1200      JULIET
1201      By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1202      ROMEO
1203      By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1204      He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1205      I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1206      As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1207      I would adventure for such merchandise.
1208      JULIET
1209      Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1210      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1211      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1212      Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1213      What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1214      Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1215      And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1216      Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1217      Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1218      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1219      Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1220      I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1221      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1222      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1223      And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1224      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1225      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1226      I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1227      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1228      My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1229      And not impute this yielding to light love,
1230      Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1231      ROMEO
1232      Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1233      That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1234      JULIET
1235      O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1236      That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1237      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1238      ROMEO
1239      What shall I swear by?
1240      JULIET
1241      Do not swear at all;
1242      Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1243      Which is the god of my idolatry,
1244      And I'll believe thee.
1245      ROMEO
1246      If my heart's dear love--
1247      JULIET
1248      Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1249      I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1250      It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1251      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1252      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1253      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1254      May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1255      Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1256      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1257      ROMEO
1258      O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1259      JULIET
1260      What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1261      ROMEO
1262      The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1263      JULIET
1264      I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1265      And yet I would it were to give again.
1266      ROMEO
1267      Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1268      JULIET
1269      But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1270      And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1271      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1272      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1273      The more I have, for both are infinite.
1274      Nurse calls within

1275      I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1276      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1277      Stay but a little, I will come again.
1278      Exit, above

1279      ROMEO
1280      O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1281      Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1282      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1283      Re-enter JULIET, above

1284      JULIET
1285      Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1286      If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1287      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1288      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1289      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1290      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1291      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1292      Nurse
1293      [Within] Madam!
1294      JULIET
1295      I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1296      I do beseech thee--
1297      Nurse
1298      [Within] Madam!
1299      JULIET
1300      By and by, I come:--
1301      To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1302      To-morrow will I send.
1303      ROMEO
1304      So thrive my soul--
1305      JULIET
1306      A thousand times good night!
1307      Exit, above

1308      ROMEO
1309      A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1310      Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1311      their books,
1312      But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1313      Retiring

1314      Re-enter JULIET, above

1315      JULIET
1316      Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1317      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1318      Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1319      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1320      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1321      With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1322      ROMEO
1323      It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1324      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1325      Like softest music to attending ears!
1326      JULIET
1327      Romeo!
1328      ROMEO
1329      My dear?
1330      JULIET
1331      At what o'clock to-morrow
1332      Shall I send to thee?
1333      ROMEO
1334      At the hour of nine.
1335      JULIET
1336      I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1337      I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1338      ROMEO
1339      Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1340      JULIET
1341      I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1342      Remembering how I love thy company.
1343      ROMEO
1344      And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1345      Forgetting any other home but this.
1346      JULIET
1347      'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1348      And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1349      Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1350      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1351      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1352      So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1353      ROMEO
1354      I would I were thy bird.
1355      JULIET
1356      Sweet, so would I:
1357      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1358      Good night, good night! parting is such
1359      sweet sorrow,
1360      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1361      Exit above

1362      ROMEO
1363      Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1364      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1365      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1366      His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1367      Exit

1368      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1369      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1370      FRIAR LAURENCE
1371      The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1372      Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1373      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1374      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1375      Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1376      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1377      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1378      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1379      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1380      What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1381      And from her womb children of divers kind
1382      We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1383      Many for many virtues excellent,
1384      None but for some and yet all different.
1385      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1386      In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1387      For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1388      But to the earth some special good doth give,
1389      Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1390      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1391      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1392      And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1393      Within the infant rind of this small flower
1394      Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1395      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1396      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1397      Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1398      In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1399      And where the worser is predominant,
1400      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1401      Enter ROMEO

1402      ROMEO
1403      Good morrow, father.
1404      FRIAR LAURENCE
1405      Benedicite!
1406      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1407      Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1408      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1409      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1410      And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1411      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1412      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1413      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1414      Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1415      Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1416      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1417      ROMEO
1418      That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1419      FRIAR LAURENCE
1420      God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1421      ROMEO
1422      With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1423      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1424      FRIAR LAURENCE
1425      That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1426      ROMEO
1427      I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1428      I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1429      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1430      That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1431      Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1432      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1433      My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1434      FRIAR LAURENCE
1435      Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1436      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1437      ROMEO
1438      Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1439      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1440      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1441      And all combined, save what thou must combine
1442      By holy marriage: when and where and how
1443      We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1444      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1445      That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1446      FRIAR LAURENCE
1447      Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1448      Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1449      So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1450      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1451      Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1452      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1453      How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1454      To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1455      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1456      Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1457      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1458      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1459      If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1460      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1461      And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1462      Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1463      ROMEO
1464      Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1465      FRIAR LAURENCE
1466      For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1467      ROMEO
1468      And bad'st me bury love.
1469      FRIAR LAURENCE
1470      Not in a grave,
1471      To lay one in, another out to have.
1472      ROMEO
1473      I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1474      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1475      The other did not so.
1476      FRIAR LAURENCE
1477      O, she knew well
1478      Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1479      But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1480      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1481      For this alliance may so happy prove,
1482      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1483      ROMEO
1484      O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1485      FRIAR LAURENCE
1486      Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1487      Exeunt

1488      SCENE IV. A street.
1489      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1490      MERCUTIO
1491      Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1492      Came he not home to-night?
1493      BENVOLIO
1494      Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1495      MERCUTIO
1496      Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1497      Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1498      BENVOLIO
1499      Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1500      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1501      MERCUTIO
1502      A challenge, on my life.
1503      BENVOLIO
1504      Romeo will answer it.
1505      MERCUTIO
1506      Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1507      BENVOLIO
1508      Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1509      dares, being dared.
1510      MERCUTIO
1511      Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1512      white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1513      love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1514      blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1515      encounter Tybalt?
1516      BENVOLIO
1517      Why, what is Tybalt?
1518      MERCUTIO
1519      More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1520      the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1521      you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1522      proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1523      the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1524      button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1525      very first house, of the first and second cause:
1526      ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1527      hai!
1528      BENVOLIO
1529      The what?
1530      MERCUTIO
1531      The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1532      fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1533      a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1534      whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1535      grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1536      these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1537      perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1538      that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1539      bones, their bones!
1540      Enter ROMEO

1541      BENVOLIO
1542      Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1543      MERCUTIO
1544      Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1545      how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1546      that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1547      kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1548      be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1549      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1550      eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1551      Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1552      to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1553      fairly last night.
1554      ROMEO
1555      Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1556      MERCUTIO
1557      The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1558      ROMEO
1559      Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1560      such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1561      MERCUTIO
1562      That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1563      constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1564      ROMEO
1565      Meaning, to court'sy.
1566      MERCUTIO
1567      Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1568      ROMEO
1569      A most courteous exposition.
1570      MERCUTIO
1571      Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1572      ROMEO
1573      Pink for flower.
1574      MERCUTIO
1575      Right.
1576      ROMEO
1577      Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1578      MERCUTIO
1579      Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1580      worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1581      is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1582      ROMEO
1583      O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1584      singleness.
1585      MERCUTIO
1586      Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1587      ROMEO
1588      Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1589      MERCUTIO
1590      Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1591      done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1592      thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1593      was I with you there for the goose?
1594      ROMEO
1595      Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1596      not there for the goose.
1597      MERCUTIO
1598      I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1599      ROMEO
1600      Nay, good goose, bite not.
1601      MERCUTIO
1602      Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1603      sharp sauce.
1604      ROMEO
1605      And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1606      MERCUTIO
1607      O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1608      inch narrow to an ell broad!
1609      ROMEO
1610      I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1611      to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1612      MERCUTIO
1613      Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1614      now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1615      thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1616      for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1617      that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1618      BENVOLIO
1619      Stop there, stop there.
1620      MERCUTIO
1621      Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1622      BENVOLIO
1623      Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1624      MERCUTIO
1625      O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1626      for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1627      meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1628      ROMEO
1629      Here's goodly gear!
1630      Enter Nurse and PETER

1631      MERCUTIO
1632      A sail, a sail!
1633      BENVOLIO
1634      Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1635      Nurse
1636      Peter!
1637      PETER
1638      Anon!
1639      Nurse
1640      My fan, Peter.
1641      MERCUTIO
1642      Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1643      fairer face.
1644      Nurse
1645      God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1646      MERCUTIO
1647      God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1648      Nurse
1649      Is it good den?
1650      MERCUTIO
1651      'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1652      dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1653      Nurse
1654      Out upon you! what a man are you!
1655      ROMEO
1656      One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1657      mar.
1658      Nurse
1659      By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1660      quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1661      may find the young Romeo?
1662      ROMEO
1663      I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1664      you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1665      I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1666      Nurse
1667      You say well.
1668      MERCUTIO
1669      Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1670      wisely, wisely.
1671      Nurse
1672      if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1673      you.
1674      BENVOLIO
1675      She will indite him to some supper.
1676      MERCUTIO
1677      A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1678      ROMEO
1679      What hast thou found?
1680      MERCUTIO
1681      No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1682      that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1683      Sings

1684      An old hare hoar,
1685      And an old hare hoar,
1686      Is very good meat in lent
1687      But a hare that is hoar
1688      Is too much for a score,
1689      When it hoars ere it be spent.
1690      Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1691      to dinner, thither.
1692      ROMEO
1693      I will follow you.
1694      MERCUTIO
1695      Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1696      Singing

1697      'lady, lady, lady.'
1698      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

1699      Nurse
1700      Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1701      merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1702      ROMEO
1703      A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1704      and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1705      to in a month.
1706      Nurse
1707      An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1708      down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1709      Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1710      Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1711      none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1712      too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1713      PETER
1714      I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1715      should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1716      draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1717      good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1718      Nurse
1719      Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1720      me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1721      and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1722      out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1723      but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1724      a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1725      kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1726      is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1727      with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1728      to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1729      ROMEO
1730      Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1731      protest unto thee--
1732      Nurse
1733      Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1734      Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1735      ROMEO
1736      What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1737      Nurse
1738      I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1739      I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1740      ROMEO
1741      Bid her devise
1742      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1743      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1744      Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1745      Nurse
1746      No truly sir; not a penny.
1747      ROMEO
1748      Go to; I say you shall.
1749      Nurse
1750      This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1751      ROMEO
1752      And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1753      Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1754      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1755      Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1756      Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1757      Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1758      Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1759      Nurse
1760      Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1761      ROMEO
1762      What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1763      Nurse
1764      Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1765      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1766      ROMEO
1767      I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1768      NURSE
1769      Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1770      Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1771      is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1772      lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1773      see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1774      sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1775      man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1776      as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1777      rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1778      ROMEO
1779      Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1780      Nurse
1781      Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1782      the--No; I know it begins with some other
1783      letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1784      it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1785      to hear it.
1786      ROMEO
1787      Commend me to thy lady.
1788      Nurse
1789      Ay, a thousand times.
1790      Exit Romeo

1791      Peter!
1792      PETER
1793      Anon!
1794      Nurse
1795      Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1796      Exeunt

1797      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1798      Enter JULIET
1799      JULIET
1800      The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1801      In half an hour she promised to return.
1802      Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1803      O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1804      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1805      Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1806      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1807      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1808      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1809      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1810      Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1811      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1812      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1813      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1814      And his to me:
1815      But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1816      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1817      O God, she comes!
1818      Enter Nurse and PETER

1819      O honey nurse, what news?
1820      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1821      Nurse
1822      Peter, stay at the gate.
1823      Exit PETER

1824      JULIET
1825      Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1826      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1827      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1828      By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1829      Nurse
1830      I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1831      Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1832      JULIET
1833      I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1834      Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1835      Nurse
1836      Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1837      Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1838      JULIET
1839      How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1840      To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1841      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1842      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1843      Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1844      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1845      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1846      Nurse
1847      Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1848      how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1849      face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1850      all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1851      though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1852      past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1853      but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1854      ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1855      JULIET
1856      No, no: but all this did I know before.
1857      What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1858      Nurse
1859      Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1860      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1861      My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1862      Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1863      To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1864      JULIET
1865      I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1866      Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1867      Nurse
1868      Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1869      courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1870      warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1871      JULIET
1872      Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1873      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1874      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1875      Where is your mother?'
1876      Nurse
1877      O God's lady dear!
1878      Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1879      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1880      Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1881      JULIET
1882      Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1883      Nurse
1884      Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1885      JULIET
1886      I have.
1887      Nurse
1888      Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1889      There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1890      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1891      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1892      Hie you to church; I must another way,
1893      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1894      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1895      I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1896      But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1897      Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1898      JULIET
1899      Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1900      Exeunt

1901      SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1902      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1903      FRIAR LAURENCE
1904      So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1905      That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1906      ROMEO
1907      Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1908      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1909      That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1910      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1911      Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1912      It is enough I may but call her mine.
1913      FRIAR LAURENCE
1914      These violent delights have violent ends
1915      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1916      Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1917      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1918      And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1919      Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1920      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1921      Enter JULIET

1922      Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1923      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1924      A lover may bestride the gossamer
1925      That idles in the wanton summer air,
1926      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1927      JULIET
1928      Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1929      FRIAR LAURENCE
1930      Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1931      JULIET
1932      As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1933      ROMEO
1934      Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1935      Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1936      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1937      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1938      Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1939      Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1940      JULIET
1941      Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1942      Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
1943      They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1944      But my true love is grown to such excess
1945      I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
1946      FRIAR LAURENCE
1947      Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1948      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
1949      Till holy church incorporate two in one.
1950      Exeunt

1951      ACT III
1952      SCENE I. A public place.
1953      Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
1954      BENVOLIO
1955      I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
1956      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
1957      And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
1958      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
1959      MERCUTIO
1960      Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
1961      enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
1962      upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
1963      thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
1964      it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
1965      BENVOLIO
1966      Am I like such a fellow?
1967      MERCUTIO
1968      Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
1969      any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
1970      soon moody to be moved.
1971      BENVOLIO
1972      And what to?
1973      MERCUTIO
1974      Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
1975      shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
1976      thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
1977      or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1978      wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1979      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1980      eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1981      Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
1982      meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1983      an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1984      man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1985      wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1986      didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
1987      his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1988      tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1989      wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
1990      BENVOLIO
1991      An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1992      should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
1993      MERCUTIO
1994      The fee-simple! O simple!
1995      BENVOLIO
1996      By my head, here come the Capulets.
1997      MERCUTIO
1998      By my heel, I care not.
1999      Enter TYBALT and others

2000      TYBALT
2001      Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2002      Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2003      MERCUTIO
2004      And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2005      something; make it a word and a blow.
2006      TYBALT
2007      You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2008      will give me occasion.
2009      MERCUTIO
2010      Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2011      TYBALT
2012      Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2013      MERCUTIO
2014      Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2015      thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2016      discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2017      make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2018      BENVOLIO
2019      We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2020      Either withdraw unto some private place,
2021      And reason coldly of your grievances,
2022      Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2023      MERCUTIO
2024      Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2025      I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2026      Enter ROMEO

2027      TYBALT
2028      Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2029      MERCUTIO
2030      But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2031      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2032      Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2033      TYBALT
2034      Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2035      No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2036      ROMEO
2037      Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2038      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2039      To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2040      Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2041      TYBALT
2042      Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2043      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2044      ROMEO
2045      I do protest, I never injured thee,
2046      But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2047      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2048      And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2049      As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2050      MERCUTIO
2051      O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2052      Alla stoccata carries it away.
2053      Draws

2054      Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2055      TYBALT
2056      What wouldst thou have with me?
2057      MERCUTIO
2058      Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2059      lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2060      shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2061      eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2062      by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2063      ears ere it be out.
2064      TYBALT
2065      I am for you.
2066      Drawing

2067      ROMEO
2068      Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2069      MERCUTIO
2070      Come, sir, your passado.
2071      They fight

2072      ROMEO
2073      Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2074      Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2075      Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2076      Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2077      Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2078      TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

2079      MERCUTIO
2080      I am hurt.
2081      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2082      Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2083      BENVOLIO
2084      What, art thou hurt?
2085      MERCUTIO
2086      Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2087      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2088      Exit Page

2089      ROMEO
2090      Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2091      MERCUTIO
2092      No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2093      church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2094      me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2095      am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2096      both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2097      cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2098      rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2099      arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2100      was hurt under your arm.
2101      ROMEO
2102      I thought all for the best.
2103      MERCUTIO
2104      Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2105      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2106      They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2107      And soundly too: your houses!
2108      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

2109      ROMEO
2110      This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2111      My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2112      In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2113      With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2114      Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2115      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2116      And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2117      Re-enter BENVOLIO

2118      BENVOLIO
2119      O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2120      That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2121      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2122      ROMEO
2123      This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2124      This but begins the woe, others must end.
2125      BENVOLIO
2126      Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2127      ROMEO
2128      Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2129      Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2130      And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2131      Re-enter TYBALT

2132      Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2133      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2134      Is but a little way above our heads,
2135      Staying for thine to keep him company:
2136      Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2137      TYBALT
2138      Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2139      Shalt with him hence.
2140      ROMEO
2141      This shall determine that.
2142      They fight; TYBALT falls

2143      BENVOLIO
2144      Romeo, away, be gone!
2145      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2146      Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2147      If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2148      ROMEO
2149      O, I am fortune's fool!
2150      BENVOLIO
2151      Why dost thou stay?
2152      Exit ROMEO

2153      Enter Citizens, & c

2154      First Citizen
2155      Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2156      Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2157      BENVOLIO
2158      There lies that Tybalt.
2159      First Citizen
2160      Up, sir, go with me;
2161      I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2162      Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

2163      PRINCE
2164      Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2165      BENVOLIO
2166      O noble prince, I can discover all
2167      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2168      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2169      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2170      LADY CAPULET
2171      Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2172      O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2173      O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2174      For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2175      O cousin, cousin!
2176      PRINCE
2177      Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2178      BENVOLIO
2179      Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2180      Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2181      How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2182      Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2183      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2184      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2185      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2186      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2187      Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2188      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2189      Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2190      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2191      Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2192      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2193      his tongue,
2194      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2195      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2196      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2197      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2198      But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2199      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2200      And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2201      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2202      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2203      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2204      LADY CAPULET
2205      He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2206      Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2207      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2208      And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2209      I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2210      Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2211      PRINCE
2212      Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2213      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2214      MONTAGUE
2215      Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2216      His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2217      The life of Tybalt.
2218      PRINCE
2219      And for that offence
2220      Immediately we do exile him hence:
2221      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2222      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2223      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2224      That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2225      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2226      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2227      Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2228      Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2229      Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2230      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2231      Exeunt

2232      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2233      Enter JULIET
2234      JULIET
2235      Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2236      Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2237      As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2238      And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2239      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2240      That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2241      Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2242      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2243      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2244      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2245      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2246      And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2247      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2248      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2249      With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2250      Think true love acted simple modesty.
2251      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2252      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2253      Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2254      Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2255      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2256      Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2257      And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2258      That all the world will be in love with night
2259      And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2260      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2261      But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2262      Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2263      As is the night before some festival
2264      To an impatient child that hath new robes
2265      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2266      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2267      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2268      Enter Nurse, with cords

2269      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2270      That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2271      Nurse
2272      Ay, ay, the cords.
2273      Throws them down

2274      JULIET
2275      Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2276      Nurse
2277      Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2278      We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2279      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2280      JULIET
2281      Can heaven be so envious?
2282      Nurse
2283      Romeo can,
2284      Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2285      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2286      JULIET
2287      What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2288      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2289      Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2290      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2291      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2292      I am not I, if there be such an I;
2293      Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2294      If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2295      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2296      Nurse
2297      I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2298      God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2299      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2300      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2301      All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2302      JULIET
2303      O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2304      To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2305      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2306      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2307      Nurse
2308      O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2309      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2310      That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2311      JULIET
2312      What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2313      Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2314      My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2315      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2316      For who is living, if those two are gone?
2317      Nurse
2318      Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2319      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2320      JULIET
2321      O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2322      Nurse
2323      It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2324      JULIET
2325      O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2326      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2327      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2328      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2329      Despised substance of divinest show!
2330      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2331      A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2332      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2333      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2334      In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2335      Was ever book containing such vile matter
2336      So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2337      In such a gorgeous palace!
2338      Nurse
2339      There's no trust,
2340      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2341      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2342      Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2343      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2344      Shame come to Romeo!
2345      JULIET
2346      Blister'd be thy tongue
2347      For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2348      Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2349      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2350      Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2351      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2352      Nurse
2353      Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2354      JULIET
2355      Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2356      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2357      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2358      But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2359      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2360      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2361      Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2362      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2363      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2364      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2365      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2366      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2367      That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2368      But, O, it presses to my memory,
2369      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2370      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2371      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2372      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2373      Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2374      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2375      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2376      Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2377      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2378      Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2379      But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2380      'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2381      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2382      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2383      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2384      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2385      Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2386      Nurse
2387      Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2388      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2389      JULIET
2390      Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2391      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2392      Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2393      Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2394      He made you for a highway to my bed;
2395      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2396      Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2397      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2398      Nurse
2399      Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2400      To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2401      Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2402      I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2403      JULIET
2404      O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2405      And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2406      Exeunt

2407      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2408      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2409      FRIAR LAURENCE
2410      Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2411      Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2412      And thou art wedded to calamity.
2413      Enter ROMEO

2414      ROMEO
2415      Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2416      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2417      That I yet know not?
2418      FRIAR LAURENCE
2419      Too familiar
2420      Is my dear son with such sour company:
2421      I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2422      ROMEO
2423      What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2424      FRIAR LAURENCE
2425      A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2426      Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2427      ROMEO
2428      Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2429      For exile hath more terror in his look,
2430      Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2431      FRIAR LAURENCE
2432      Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2433      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2434      ROMEO
2435      There is no world without Verona walls,
2436      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2437      Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2438      And world's exile is death: then banished,
2439      Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2440      Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2441      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2442      FRIAR LAURENCE
2443      O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2444      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2445      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2446      And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2447      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2448      ROMEO
2449      'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2450      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2451      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2452      Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2453      But Romeo may not: more validity,
2454      More honourable state, more courtship lives
2455      In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2456      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2457      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2458      Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2459      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2460      But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2461      Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2462      They are free men, but I am banished.
2463      And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2464      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2465      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2466      But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2467      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2468      Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2469      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2470      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2471      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2472      FRIAR LAURENCE
2473      Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2474      ROMEO
2475      O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2476      FRIAR LAURENCE
2477      I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2478      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2479      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2480      ROMEO
2481      Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2482      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2483      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2484      It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2485      FRIAR LAURENCE
2486      O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2487      ROMEO
2488      How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2489      FRIAR LAURENCE
2490      Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2491      ROMEO
2492      Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2493      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2494      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2495      Doting like me and like me banished,
2496      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2497      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2498      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2499      Knocking within

2500      FRIAR LAURENCE
2501      Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2502      ROMEO
2503      Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2504      Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2505      Knocking

2506      FRIAR LAURENCE
2507      Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2508      Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2509      Knocking

2510      Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2511      What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2512      Knocking

2513      Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2514      Nurse
2515      [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2516      my errand;
2517      I come from Lady Juliet.
2518      FRIAR LAURENCE
2519      Welcome, then.
2520      Enter Nurse

2521      Nurse
2522      O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2523      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2524      FRIAR LAURENCE
2525      There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2526      Nurse
2527      O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2528      Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2529      Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2530      Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2531      Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2532      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2533      Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2534      ROMEO
2535      Nurse!
2536      Nurse
2537      Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2538      ROMEO
2539      Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2540      Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2541      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2542      With blood removed but little from her own?
2543      Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2544      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2545      Nurse
2546      O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2547      And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2548      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2549      And then down falls again.
2550      ROMEO
2551      As if that name,
2552      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2553      Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2554      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2555      In what vile part of this anatomy
2556      Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2557      The hateful mansion.
2558      Drawing his sword

2559      FRIAR LAURENCE
2560      Hold thy desperate hand:
2561      Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2562      Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2563      The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2564      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2565      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2566      Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2567      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2568      Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2569      And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2570      By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2571      Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2572      Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2573      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2574      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2575      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2576      And usest none in that true use indeed
2577      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2578      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2579      Digressing from the valour of a man;
2580      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2581      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2582      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2583      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2584      Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2585      Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2586      And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2587      What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2588      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2589      There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2590      But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2591      The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2592      And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2593      A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2594      Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2595      But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2596      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2597      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2598      Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2599      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2600      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2601      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2602      Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2603      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2604      Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2605      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2606      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2607      Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2608      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2609      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2610      Romeo is coming.
2611      Nurse
2612      O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2613      To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2614      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2615      ROMEO
2616      Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2617      Nurse
2618      Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2619      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2620      Exit

2621      ROMEO
2622      How well my comfort is revived by this!
2623      FRIAR LAURENCE
2624      Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2625      Either be gone before the watch be set,
2626      Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2627      Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2628      And he shall signify from time to time
2629      Every good hap to you that chances here:
2630      Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2631      ROMEO
2632      But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2633      It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2634      Exeunt

2635      SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2636      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2637      CAPULET
2638      Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2639      That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2640      Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2641      And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2642      'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2643      I promise you, but for your company,
2644      I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2645      PARIS
2646      These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2647      Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2648      LADY CAPULET
2649      I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2650      To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2651      CAPULET
2652      Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2653      Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2654      In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2655      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2656      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2657      And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2658      But, soft! what day is this?
2659      PARIS
2660      Monday, my lord,
2661      CAPULET
2662      Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2663      O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2664      She shall be married to this noble earl.
2665      Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2666      We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2667      For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2668      It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2669      Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2670      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2671      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2672      PARIS
2673      My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2674      CAPULET
2675      Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2676      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2677      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2678      Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2679      Afore me! it is so very very late,
2680      That we may call it early by and by.
2681      Good night.
2682      Exeunt

2683      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2684      Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2685      JULIET
2686      Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2687      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2688      That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2689      Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2690      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2691      ROMEO
2692      It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2693      No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2694      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2695      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2696      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2697      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2698      JULIET
2699      Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2700      It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2701      To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2702      And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2703      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2704      ROMEO
2705      Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2706      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2707      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2708      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2709      Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2710      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2711      I have more care to stay than will to go:
2712      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2713      How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2714      JULIET
2715      It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2716      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2717      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2718      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2719      This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2720      Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2721      O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2722      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2723      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2724      O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2725      ROMEO
2726      More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2727      Enter Nurse, to the chamber

2728      Nurse
2729      Madam!
2730      JULIET
2731      Nurse?
2732      Nurse
2733      Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2734      The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2735      Exit

2736      JULIET
2737      Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2738      ROMEO
2739      Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2740      He goeth down

2741      JULIET
2742      Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2743      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2744      For in a minute there are many days:
2745      O, by this count I shall be much in years
2746      Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2747      ROMEO
2748      Farewell!
2749      I will omit no opportunity
2750      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2751      JULIET
2752      O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2753      ROMEO
2754      I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2755      For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2756      JULIET
2757      O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2758      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2759      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2760      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2761      ROMEO
2762      And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2763      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2764      Exit

2765      JULIET
2766      O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2767      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2768      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2769      For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2770      But send him back.
2771      LADY CAPULET
2772      [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2773      JULIET
2774      Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2775      Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2776      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2777      Enter LADY CAPULET

2778      LADY CAPULET
2779      Why, how now, Juliet!
2780      JULIET
2781      Madam, I am not well.
2782      LADY CAPULET
2783      Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2784      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2785      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2786      Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2787      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2788      JULIET
2789      Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2790      LADY CAPULET
2791      So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2792      Which you weep for.
2793      JULIET
2794      Feeling so the loss,
2795      Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2796      LADY CAPULET
2797      Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2798      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2799      JULIET
2800      What villain madam?
2801      LADY CAPULET
2802      That same villain, Romeo.
2803      JULIET
2804      [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2805      God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2806      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2807      LADY CAPULET
2808      That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2809      JULIET
2810      Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2811      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2812      LADY CAPULET
2813      We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2814      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2815      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2816      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2817      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2818      And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2819      JULIET
2820      Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2821      With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2822      Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2823      Madam, if you could find out but a man
2824      To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2825      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2826      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2827      To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2828      To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2829      Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2830      LADY CAPULET
2831      Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2832      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2833      JULIET
2834      And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2835      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2836      LADY CAPULET
2837      Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2838      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2839      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2840      That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2841      JULIET
2842      Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2843      LADY CAPULET
2844      Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2845      The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2846      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2847      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2848      JULIET
2849      Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2850      He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2851      I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2852      Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2853      I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2854      I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2855      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2856      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2857      LADY CAPULET
2858      Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2859      And see how he will take it at your hands.
2860      Enter CAPULET and Nurse

2861      CAPULET
2862      When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2863      But for the sunset of my brother's son
2864      It rains downright.
2865      How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2866      Evermore showering? In one little body
2867      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2868      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2869      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2870      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2871      Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2872      Without a sudden calm, will overset
2873      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2874      Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2875      LADY CAPULET
2876      Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2877      I would the fool were married to her grave!
2878      CAPULET
2879      Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2880      How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2881      Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2882      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2883      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2884      JULIET
2885      Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2886      Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2887      But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2888      CAPULET
2889      How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2890      'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2891      And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2892      Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2893      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2894      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2895      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2896      Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2897      You tallow-face!
2898      LADY CAPULET
2899      Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2900      JULIET
2901      Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2902      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2903      CAPULET
2904      Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2905      I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2906      Or never after look me in the face:
2907      Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2908      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2909      That God had lent us but this only child;
2910      But now I see this one is one too much,
2911      And that we have a curse in having her:
2912      Out on her, hilding!
2913      Nurse
2914      God in heaven bless her!
2915      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2916      CAPULET
2917      And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2918      Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
2919      Nurse
2920      I speak no treason.
2921      CAPULET
2922      O, God ye god-den.
2923      Nurse
2924      May not one speak?
2925      CAPULET
2926      Peace, you mumbling fool!
2927      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
2928      For here we need it not.
2929      LADY CAPULET
2930      You are too hot.
2931      CAPULET
2932      God's bread! it makes me mad:
2933      Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2934      Alone, in company, still my care hath been
2935      To have her match'd: and having now provided
2936      A gentleman of noble parentage,
2937      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2938      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2939      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
2940      And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2941      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2942      To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2943      I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2944      But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
2945      Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2946      Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2947      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2948      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2949      And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
2950      the streets,
2951      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2952      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2953      Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
2954      Exit

2955      JULIET
2956      Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2957      That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2958      O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2959      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2960      Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
2961      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2962      LADY CAPULET
2963      Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2964      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
2965      Exit

2966      JULIET
2967      O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2968      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2969      How shall that faith return again to earth,
2970      Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2971      By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2972      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2973      Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2974      What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2975      Some comfort, nurse.
2976      Nurse
2977      Faith, here it is.
2978      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
2979      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2980      Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2981      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2982      I think it best you married with the county.
2983      O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2984      Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2985      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2986      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2987      I think you are happy in this second match,
2988      For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2989      Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2990      As living here and you no use of him.
2991      JULIET
2992      Speakest thou from thy heart?
2993      Nurse
2994      And from my soul too;
2995      Or else beshrew them both.
2996      JULIET
2997      Amen!
2998      Nurse
2999      What?
3000      JULIET
3001      Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3002      Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3003      Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3004      To make confession and to be absolved.
3005      Nurse
3006      Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3007      Exit

3008      JULIET
3009      Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3010      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3011      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3012      Which she hath praised him with above compare
3013      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3014      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3015      I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3016      If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3017      Exit

3018      ACT IV
3019      SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
3020      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
3021      FRIAR LAURENCE
3022      On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3023      PARIS
3024      My father Capulet will have it so;
3025      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3026      FRIAR LAURENCE
3027      You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3028      Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3029      PARIS
3030      Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3031      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3032      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3033      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3034      That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3035      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3036      To stop the inundation of her tears;
3037      Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3038      May be put from her by society:
3039      Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3040      FRIAR LAURENCE
3041      [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3042      Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3043      Enter JULIET

3044      PARIS
3045      Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3046      JULIET
3047      That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3048      PARIS
3049      That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3050      JULIET
3051      What must be shall be.
3052      FRIAR LAURENCE
3053      That's a certain text.
3054      PARIS
3055      Come you to make confession to this father?
3056      JULIET
3057      To answer that, I should confess to you.
3058      PARIS
3059      Do not deny to him that you love me.
3060      JULIET
3061      I will confess to you that I love him.
3062      PARIS
3063      So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3064      JULIET
3065      If I do so, it will be of more price,
3066      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3067      PARIS
3068      Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3069      JULIET
3070      The tears have got small victory by that;
3071      For it was bad enough before their spite.
3072      PARIS
3073      Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3074      JULIET
3075      That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3076      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3077      PARIS
3078      Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3079      JULIET
3080      It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3081      Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3082      Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3083      FRIAR LAURENCE
3084      My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3085      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3086      PARIS
3087      God shield I should disturb devotion!
3088      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3089      Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3090      Exit

3091      JULIET
3092      O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3093      Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3094      FRIAR LAURENCE
3095      Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3096      It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3097      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3098      On Thursday next be married to this county.
3099      JULIET
3100      Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3101      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3102      If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3103      Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3104      And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3105      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3106      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3107      Shall be the label to another deed,
3108      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3109      Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3110      Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3111      Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3112      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3113      Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3114      Which the commission of thy years and art
3115      Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3116      Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3117      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3118      FRIAR LAURENCE
3119      Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3120      Which craves as desperate an execution.
3121      As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3122      If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3123      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3124      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3125      A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3126      That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3127      And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3128      JULIET
3129      O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3130      From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3131      Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3132      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3133      Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3134      O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3135      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3136      Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3137      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3138      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3139      And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3140      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3141      FRIAR LAURENCE
3142      Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3143      To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3144      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3145      Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3146      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3147      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3148      When presently through all thy veins shall run
3149      A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3150      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3151      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3152      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3153      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3154      Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3155      Each part, deprived of supple government,
3156      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3157      And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3158      Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3159      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3160      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3161      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3162      Then, as the manner of our country is,
3163      In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3164      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3165      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3166      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3167      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3168      And hither shall he come: and he and I
3169      Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3170      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3171      And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3172      If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3173      Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3174      JULIET
3175      Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3176      FRIAR LAURENCE
3177      Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3178      In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3179      To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3180      JULIET
3181      Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3182      Farewell, dear father!
3183      Exeunt

3184      SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
3185      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
3186      CAPULET
3187      So many guests invite as here are writ.
3188      Exit First Servant

3189      Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3190      Second Servant
3191      You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3192      can lick their fingers.
3193      CAPULET
3194      How canst thou try them so?
3195      Second Servant
3196      Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3197      own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3198      fingers goes not with me.
3199      CAPULET
3200      Go, be gone.
3201      Exit Second Servant

3202      We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3203      What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3204      Nurse
3205      Ay, forsooth.
3206      CAPULET
3207      Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3208      A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3209      Nurse
3210      See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3211      Enter JULIET

3212      CAPULET
3213      How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3214      JULIET
3215      Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3216      Of disobedient opposition
3217      To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3218      By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3219      And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3220      Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3221      CAPULET
3222      Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3223      I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3224      JULIET
3225      I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3226      And gave him what becomed love I might,
3227      Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3228      CAPULET
3229      Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3230      This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3231      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3232      Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3233      Our whole city is much bound to him.
3234      JULIET
3235      Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3236      To help me sort such needful ornaments
3237      As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3238      LADY CAPULET
3239      No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3240      CAPULET
3241      Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3242      Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

3243      LADY CAPULET
3244      We shall be short in our provision:
3245      'Tis now near night.
3246      CAPULET
3247      Tush, I will stir about,
3248      And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3249      Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3250      I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3251      I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3252      They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3253      To County Paris, to prepare him up
3254      Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3255      Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3256      Exeunt

3257      SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3258      Enter JULIET and Nurse
3259      JULIET
3260      Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3261      I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3262      For I have need of many orisons
3263      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3264      Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3265      Enter LADY CAPULET

3266      LADY CAPULET
3267      What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3268      JULIET
3269      No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3270      As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3271      So please you, let me now be left alone,
3272      And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3273      For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3274      In this so sudden business.
3275      LADY CAPULET
3276      Good night:
3277      Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3278      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

3279      JULIET
3280      Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3281      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3282      That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3283      I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3284      Nurse! What should she do here?
3285      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3286      Come, vial.
3287      What if this mixture do not work at all?
3288      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3289      No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3290      Laying down her dagger

3291      What if it be a poison, which the friar
3292      Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3293      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3294      Because he married me before to Romeo?
3295      I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3296      For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3297      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3298      I wake before the time that Romeo
3299      Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3300      Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3301      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3302      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3303      Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3304      The horrible conceit of death and night,
3305      Together with the terror of the place,--
3306      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3307      Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3308      Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3309      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3310      Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3311      At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3312      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3313      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3314      And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3315      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3316      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3317      Environed with all these hideous fears?
3318      And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3319      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3320      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3321      As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3322      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3323      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3324      Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3325      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
3326      She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

3327      SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
3328      Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3329      LADY CAPULET
3330      Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
3331      Nurse
3332      They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3333      Enter CAPULET

3334      CAPULET
3335      Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3336      The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3337      Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3338      Spare not for the cost.
3339      Nurse
3340      Go, you cot-quean, go,
3341      Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3342      For this night's watching.
3343      CAPULET
3344      No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3345      All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3346      LADY CAPULET
3347      Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3348      But I will watch you from such watching now.
3349      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

3350      CAPULET
3351      A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
3352      Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets

3353      Now, fellow,
3354      What's there?
3355      First Servant
3356      Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
3357      CAPULET
3358      Make haste, make haste.
3359      Exit First Servant

3360      Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3361      Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3362      Second Servant
3363      I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
3364      And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3365      Exit

3366      CAPULET
3367      Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3368      Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3369      The county will be here with music straight,
3370      For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3371      Music within

3372      Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3373      Re-enter Nurse

3374      Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
3375      I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
3376      Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
3377      Make haste, I say.
3378      Exeunt

3379      SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
3380      Enter Nurse
3381      Nurse
3382      Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
3383      Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3384      Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3385      What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3386      Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3387      The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3388      That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3389      Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3390      I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3391      Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3392      He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3393      Undraws the curtains

3394      What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3395      I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3396      Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3397      O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3398      Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
3399      Enter LADY CAPULET

3400      LADY CAPULET
3401      What noise is here?
3402      Nurse
3403      O lamentable day!
3404      LADY CAPULET
3405      What is the matter?
3406      Nurse
3407      Look, look! O heavy day!
3408      LADY CAPULET
3409      O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3410      Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3411      Help, help! Call help.
3412      Enter CAPULET

3413      CAPULET
3414      For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
3415      Nurse
3416      She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
3417      LADY CAPULET
3418      Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3419      CAPULET
3420      Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3421      Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3422      Life and these lips have long been separated:
3423      Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3424      Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3425      Nurse
3426      O lamentable day!
3427      LADY CAPULET
3428      O woful time!
3429      CAPULET
3430      Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3431      Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3432      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

3433      FRIAR LAURENCE
3434      Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3435      CAPULET
3436      Ready to go, but never to return.
3437      O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3438      Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3439      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3440      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3441      My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3442      And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3443      PARIS
3444      Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3445      And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3446      LADY CAPULET
3447      Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3448      Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3449      In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3450      But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3451      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3452      And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3453      Nurse
3454      O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3455      Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3456      That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3457      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3458      Never was seen so black a day as this:
3459      O woful day, O woful day!
3460      PARIS
3461      Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3462      Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3463      By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3464      O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3465      CAPULET
3466      Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3467      Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3468      To murder, murder our solemnity?
3469      O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3470      Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3471      And with my child my joys are buried.
3472      FRIAR LAURENCE
3473      Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3474      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3475      Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3476      And all the better is it for the maid:
3477      Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3478      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3479      The most you sought was her promotion;
3480      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3481      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3482      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3483      O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3484      That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3485      She's not well married that lives married long;
3486      But she's best married that dies married young.
3487      Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3488      On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3489      In all her best array bear her to church:
3490      For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3491      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3492      CAPULET
3493      All things that we ordained festival,
3494      Turn from their office to black funeral;
3495      Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3496      Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3497      Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3498      Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3499      And all things change them to the contrary.
3500      FRIAR LAURENCE
3501      Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3502      And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3503      To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3504      The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3505      Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3506      Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

3507      First Musician
3508      Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3509      Nurse
3510      Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3511      For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3512      Exit

3513      First Musician
3514      Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3515      Enter PETER

3516      PETER
3517      Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3518      ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3519      First Musician
3520      Why 'Heart's ease?'
3521      PETER
3522      O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3523      heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3524      to comfort me.
3525      First Musician
3526      Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3527      PETER
3528      You will not, then?
3529      First Musician
3530      No.
3531      PETER
3532      I will then give it you soundly.
3533      First Musician
3534      What will you give us?
3535      PETER
3536      No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3537      I will give you the minstrel.
3538      First Musician
3539      Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3540      PETER
3541      Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3542      your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3543      I'll fa you; do you note me?
3544      First Musician
3545      An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3546      Second Musician
3547      Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3548      PETER
3549      Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3550      with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3551      me like men:
3552      'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3553      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3554      Then music with her silver sound'--
3555      why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3556      sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3557      Musician
3558      Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3559      PETER
3560      Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3561      Second Musician
3562      I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3563      PETER
3564      Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3565      Third Musician
3566      Faith, I know not what to say.
3567      PETER
3568      O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3569      for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3570      because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3571      'Then music with her silver sound
3572      With speedy help doth lend redress.'

3574      First Musician
3575      What a pestilent knave is this same!
3576      Second Musician

3578      mourners, and stay dinner.

3580      ACT V
3581      SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3582      Enter ROMEO
3583      ROMEO
3584      If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3585      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3586      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3587      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3588      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3589      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3590      Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3591      to think!--
3592      And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3593      That I revived, and was an emperor.
3594      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3595      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3596      Enter BALTHASAR, booted

3597      News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3598      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3599      How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3600      How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3601      For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3602      BALTHASAR
3603      Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3604      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3605      And her immortal part with angels lives.
3606      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3607      And presently took post to tell it you:
3608      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3609      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3610      ROMEO
3611      Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3612      Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3613      And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3614      BALTHASAR
3615      I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3616      Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3617      Some misadventure.
3618      ROMEO
3619      Tush, thou art deceived:
3620      Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3621      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3622      BALTHASAR
3623      No, my good lord.
3624      ROMEO
3625      No matter: get thee gone,
3626      And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3627      Exit BALTHASAR

3628      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3629      Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3630      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3631      I do remember an apothecary,--
3632      And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3633      In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3634      Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3635      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3636      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3637      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3638      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3639      A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3640      Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3641      Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3642      Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3643      Noting this penury, to myself I said
3644      'An if a man did need a poison now,
3645      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3646      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3647      O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3648      And this same needy man must sell it me.
3649      As I remember, this should be the house.
3650      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3651      What, ho! apothecary!
3652      Enter Apothecary

3653      Apothecary
3654      Who calls so loud?
3655      ROMEO
3656      Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3657      Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3658      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3659      As will disperse itself through all the veins
3660      That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3661      And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3662      As violently as hasty powder fired
3663      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3664      Apothecary
3665      Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3666      Is death to any he that utters them.
3667      ROMEO
3668      Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3669      And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3670      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3671      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3672      The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3673      The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3674      Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3675      Apothecary
3676      My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3677      ROMEO
3678      I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3679      Apothecary
3680      Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3681      And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3682      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3683      ROMEO
3684      There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3685      Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3686      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3687      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3688      Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3689      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3690      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3691      Exeunt

3692      SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3693      Enter FRIAR JOHN
3694      FRIAR JOHN
3695      Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3696      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

3697      FRIAR LAURENCE
3698      This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3699      Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3700      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3701      FRIAR JOHN
3702      Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3703      One of our order, to associate me,
3704      Here in this city visiting the sick,
3705      And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3706      Suspecting that we both were in a house
3707      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3708      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3709      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3710      FRIAR LAURENCE
3711      Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3712      FRIAR JOHN
3713      I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3714      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3715      So fearful were they of infection.
3716      FRIAR LAURENCE
3717      Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3718      The letter was not nice but full of charge
3719      Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3720      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3721      Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3722      Unto my cell.
3723      FRIAR JOHN
3724      Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3725      Exit

3726      FRIAR LAURENCE
3727      Now must I to the monument alone;
3728      Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3729      She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3730      Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3731      But I will write again to Mantua,
3732      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3733      Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3734      Exit

3735      SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3736      Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3737      PARIS
3738      Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3739      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3740      Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3741      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3742      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3743      Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3744      But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3745      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3746      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3747      PAGE
3748      [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3749      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3750      Retires

3751      PARIS
3752      Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3753      O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3754      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3755      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3756      The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3757      Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3758      The Page whistles

3759      The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3760      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3761      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3762      What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3763      Retires

3764      Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

3765      ROMEO
3766      Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3767      Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3768      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3769      Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3770      Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3771      And do not interrupt me in my course.
3772      Why I descend into this bed of death,
3773      Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3774      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3775      A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3776      In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3777      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3778      In what I further shall intend to do,
3779      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3780      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3781      The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3782      More fierce and more inexorable far
3783      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3784      BALTHASAR
3785      I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3786      ROMEO
3787      So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3788      Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3789      BALTHASAR
3790      [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3791      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3792      Retires

3793      ROMEO
3794      Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3795      Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3796      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3797      And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3798      Opens the tomb

3799      PARIS
3800      This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3801      That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3802      It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3803      And here is come to do some villanous shame
3804      To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3805      Comes forward

3806      Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3807      Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3808      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3809      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3810      ROMEO
3811      I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3812      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3813      Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3814      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3815      Put not another sin upon my head,
3816      By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3817      By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3818      For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3819      Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3820      A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3821      PARIS
3822      I do defy thy conjurations,
3823      And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3824      ROMEO
3825      Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3826      They fight

3827      PAGE
3828      O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3829      Exit

3830      PARIS
3831      O, I am slain!
3832      Falls

3833      If thou be merciful,
3834      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3835      Dies

3836      ROMEO
3837      In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3838      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3839      What said my man, when my betossed soul
3840      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3841      He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3842      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3843      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
3844      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3845      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3846      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3847      A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3848      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3849      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3850      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3851      Laying PARIS in the tomb

3852      How oft when men are at the point of death
3853      Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3854      A lightning before death: O, how may I
3855      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3856      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3857      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
3858      Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
3859      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3860      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3861      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3862      O, what more favour can I do to thee,
3863      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
3864      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3865      Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
3866      Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
3867      That unsubstantial death is amorous,
3868      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
3869      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3870      For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
3871      And never from this palace of dim night
3872      Depart again: here, here will I remain
3873      With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
3874      Will I set up my everlasting rest,
3875      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3876      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3877      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3878      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
3879      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3880      Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
3881      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3882      The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
3883      Here's to my love!
3884      Drinks

3885      O true apothecary!
3886      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
3887      Dies

3888      Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

3889      FRIAR LAURENCE
3890      Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3891      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
3892      BALTHASAR
3893      Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
3894      FRIAR LAURENCE
3895      Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3896      What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3897      To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3898      It burneth in the Capel's monument.
3899      BALTHASAR
3900      It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3901      One that you love.
3902      FRIAR LAURENCE
3903      Who is it?
3904      BALTHASAR
3905      Romeo.
3906      FRIAR LAURENCE
3907      How long hath he been there?
3908      BALTHASAR
3909      Full half an hour.
3910      FRIAR LAURENCE
3911      Go with me to the vault.
3912      BALTHASAR
3913      I dare not, sir
3914      My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3915      And fearfully did menace me with death,
3916      If I did stay to look on his intents.
3917      FRIAR LAURENCE
3918      Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
3919      O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
3920      BALTHASAR
3921      As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3922      I dreamt my master and another fought,
3923      And that my master slew him.
3924      FRIAR LAURENCE
3925      Romeo!
3926      Advances

3927      Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3928      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3929      What mean these masterless and gory swords
3930      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
3931      Enters the tomb

3932      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3933      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3934      Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3935      The lady stirs.
3936      JULIET wakes

3937      JULIET
3938      O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3939      I do remember well where I should be,
3940      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
3941      Noise within

3942      FRIAR LAURENCE
3943      I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3944      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3945      A greater power than we can contradict
3946      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3947      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3948      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3949      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3950      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3951      Come, go, good Juliet,
3952      Noise again

3953      I dare no longer stay.
3954      JULIET
3955      Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3956      Exit FRIAR LAURENCE

3957      What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3958      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
3959      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3960      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3961      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3962      To make die with a restorative.
3963      Kisses him

3964      Thy lips are warm.
3965      First Watchman
3966      [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
3967      JULIET
3968      Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3969      Snatching ROMEO's dagger

3970      This is thy sheath;
3971      Stabs herself

3972      there rust, and let me die.
3973      Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

3974      Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

3975      PAGE
3976      This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
3977      First Watchman
3978      The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3979      Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3980      Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3981      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3982      Who here hath lain these two days buried.
3983      Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3984      Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3985      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3986      But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3987      We cannot without circumstance descry.
3988      Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

3989      Second Watchman
3990      Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
3991      First Watchman
3992      Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
3993      Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

3994      Third Watchman
3995      Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
3996      We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3997      As he was coming from this churchyard side.
3998      First Watchman
3999      A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4000      Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

4001      PRINCE
4002      What misadventure is so early up,
4003      That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4004      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

4005      CAPULET
4006      What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4007      LADY CAPULET
4008      The people in the street cry Romeo,
4009      Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4010      With open outcry toward our monument.
4011      PRINCE
4012      What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4013      First Watchman
4014      Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4015      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4016      Warm and new kill'd.
4017      PRINCE
4018      Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4019      First Watchman
4020      Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4021      With instruments upon them, fit to open
4022      These dead men's tombs.
4023      CAPULET
4024      O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4025      This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4026      Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4027      And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4028      LADY CAPULET
4029      O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4030      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4031      Enter MONTAGUE and others

4032      PRINCE
4033      Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4034      To see thy son and heir more early down.
4035      MONTAGUE
4036      Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4037      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4038      What further woe conspires against mine age?
4039      PRINCE
4040      Look, and thou shalt see.
4041      MONTAGUE
4042      O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4043      To press before thy father to a grave?
4044      PRINCE
4045      Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4046      Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4047      And know their spring, their head, their
4048      true descent;
4049      And then will I be general of your woes,
4050      And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4051      And let mischance be slave to patience.
4052      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4053      FRIAR LAURENCE
4054      I am the greatest, able to do least,
4055      Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4056      Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4057      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4058      Myself condemned and myself excused.
4059      PRINCE
4060      Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4061      FRIAR LAURENCE
4062      I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4063      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4064      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4065      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4066      I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4067      Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4068      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4069      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4070      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4071      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4072      To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4073      And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4074      To rid her from this second marriage,
4075      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4076      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4077      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4078      As I intended, for it wrought on her
4079      The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4080      That he should hither come as this dire night,
4081      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4082      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4083      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4084      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4085      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4086      At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4087      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4088      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4089      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4090      But when I came, some minute ere the time
4091      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4092      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4093      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4094      And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4095      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4096      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4097      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4098      All this I know; and to the marriage
4099      Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4100      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4101      Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4102      Unto the rigour of severest law.
4103      PRINCE
4104      We still have known thee for a holy man.
4105      Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4106      BALTHASAR
4107      I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4108      And then in post he came from Mantua
4109      To this same place, to this same monument.
4110      This letter he early bid me give his father,
4111      And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4112      I departed not and left him there.
4113      PRINCE
4114      Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4115      Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4116      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4117      PAGE
4118      He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4119      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4120      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4121      And by and by my master drew on him;
4122      And then I ran away to call the watch.
4123      PRINCE
4124      This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4125      Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4126      And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4127      Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4128      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4129      Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4130      See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4131      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4132      And I for winking at your discords too
4133      Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4134      CAPULET
4135      O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4136      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4137      Can I demand.
4138      MONTAGUE
4139      But I can give thee more:
4140      For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4141      That while Verona by that name is known,
4142      There shall no figure at such rate be set
4143      As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4144      CAPULET
4145      As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4146      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4147      PRINCE
4148      A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4149      The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4150      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4151      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4152      For never was a story of more woe
4153      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4154      Exeunt
